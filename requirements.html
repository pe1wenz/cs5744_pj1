          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>User Activity and Interaction (FR-7):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The backend tracks user activity and provides this data to the frontend for display, potentially using WebSockets for real-time updates, enhancing the sense of community and engagement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Payment and Subscription (FR-8):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Monetization Service manages subscription tiers and payment processing, potentially integrating with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal to provide secure and convenient payment options.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Moderation and Compliance (FR-9):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Moderation tools and policies are implemented to ensure platform integrity and user safety. This may involve human moderators or automated systems utilizing machine learning for content analysis.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Shorts (FR-10):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Video Management and Media Processing services handle the specific requirements for processing and delivering short-form video content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Affiliate Links for Content Creators (FR-11):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The backend stores and manages affiliate link data, while the frontend ensures the appropriate display and functionality of these links within creator content.
          </li>
