    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
    <div>
      <h4>Microservices Architecture</h4>
      <p>Our video streaming platform embraces a microservices architecture, recognizing its suitability for managing the complexities and scalability demands inherent to such systems. This architectural approach involves decomposing the platform into a collection of independent, specialized services, each responsible for a specific business capability. We have identified six core microservices: User Management, Video Management, Media Processing, Streaming, Search, and Recommendation. These are supported by three additional services: Authentication (with its internal components of SSO, Security Group, IAM, and VPN), Analytics, and Monetization.</p>

      <h5>Core Microservices</h5>
      <h6>User Management Service:</h6>
      <p>This service acts as the guardian of user data, managing registration, login, and profile information. It securely stores sensitive data such as usernames, securely hashed passwords, email addresses, and user preferences. Furthermore, it orchestrates user interactions, including following other users, curating playlists, and saving videos for later viewing. Crucially, it collaborates with the Auth Service to guarantee secure authentication and authorization, safeguarding user accounts and platform integrity.</p>

      <h6>Video Management Service:</h6>
      <p>This service oversees the entire lifecycle of video content. It facilitates the upload of videos by content creators, performing necessary validation and processing. Metadata associated with each video, such as title, description, tags, and thumbnails, is meticulously organized and stored in a database, likely utilizing Amazon RDS or MySQL. This service also categorizes videos, manages their availability (public, private, scheduled release), and structures them into channels or playlists for easy navigation and discovery.
      </p>

      <h6>Media Processing Service:</h6>
      <p>Central to optimizing video delivery, this service undertakes the crucial task of transcoding. It generates multiple versions of each video with varying resolutions and bitrates, ensuring smooth playback across a diverse range of devices and network conditions. Additionally, it may handle other media-related functions, including thumbnail generation, watermarking, and subtitle processing.
      </p>

      <h6>Streaming Service:</h6>
      <p>This service forms the very core of video delivery, employing industry-standard streaming protocols such as HLS or DASH for on-demand content and WebRTC for real-time live streaming. It intelligently manages adaptive bitrate streaming, dynamically adjusting video quality in response to fluctuations in network conditions. Furthermore, it implements buffering strategies to minimize playback interruptions, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable viewing experience.
      </p>

      <h6>Streaming Service:</h6>
      <p>Empowering users to efficiently navigate the platform's vast video library, this service provides robust search capabilities. Users can search based on keywords, titles, descriptions, tags, or categories. To facilitate fast and accurate search results, even with a large and growing video catalog, the service may leverage dedicated search technologies like Elasticsearch or cloud-based search services.
      </p>

      <h6>Streaming Service:</h6>
      <p>This service plays a key role in personalizing the user experience. By analyzing user data, including watch history, preferences, and interactions, it generates tailored video recommendations. Employing techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches, it suggests relevant content to users, enhancing discovery and engagement. Machine learning models may be integrated to further refine the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations.</p>

        <h4>Justification of Microservice Architecture in Video Streaming Application</h4>
        <p>This granular breakdown into microservices offers several compelling advantages. It promotes independent development and deployment, allowing teams to focus on specific services using the most appropriate technologies and tools for their respective domains. This autonomy leads to faster development cycles and the ability to deploy updates to individual services without impacting others. Furthermore, the microservices architecture enhances scalability and flexibility. As our user base expands or specific services experience peak demand, we can scale those services independently, optimizing resource utilization and cost-efficiency.</p>
        <p>Another key benefit is fault isolation. If one service encounters an error or experiences downtime, it is less likely to cascade and disrupt the entire platform. This compartmentalization enhances the system's overall resilience and availability. The microservices approach also fosters technology diversity, empowering us to choose the best tools and technologies for each service based on its specific requirements. For example, we might leverage Node.js for real-time features, Python for machine learning within the recommendation engine, and Java for our core backend services.</p>
        <p>In contrast to a monolithic architecture, where all functionalities reside within a single, large application, our microservices approach offers greater agility, scalability, and maintainability. A monolithic architecture would present challenges in terms of slower development cycles, limited scalability, reduced resilience, and potential technology lock-in. While a microservices architecture introduces some complexity in managing inter-service communication, the benefits it offers in our context far outweigh these challenges.</p>
        <p>To effectively implement our microservices architecture, we have carefully considered several key aspects. A robust API gateway is essential for managing communication between services, ensuring seamless interaction and data exchange. Service discovery mechanisms enable services to dynamically locate each other within the distributed environment. Maintaining data consistency across various services is crucial, and we have implemented strategies to ensure data integrity. Finally, comprehensive monitoring and logging practices allow us to track performance, identify potential issues, and maintain the health and stability of our platform.
